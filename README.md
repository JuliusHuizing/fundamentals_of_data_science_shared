# README
This repository contains everything related to the group assignment for the fundamentals of data science project.

## Set-up
This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) to manage python dependencies.
To install Poetry, run:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```
For more detailed instructions/troubleshooting, see the [poetry docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).
After you have installed Poetry, you can spawn a shell:

```bash

poetry shell

```
After spawning the shell, you might still need to activate the corresponding environment in your IDE.
For example, if you are using VScode, you can find the poetry environment by running a notebook and searching under the python environments.
